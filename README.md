# Personal Homebrew Caskroom
This is a brew cask tap repository for unofficial app/font casks I personally use. Please note that this repo does not host any apps or fonts, it just provides homebrew formulaes that links to them on external resources.  

## Installation
```shell
brew tap sepehr/caskroom
```

## Casks
### Apps
- popcorn-time
- patterns

### Fonts
- font-sansie

### Merged
These casks are merged into the main caskroom repos:

- font-iranian-sans
- font-iranian-serif
- font-vazir-code
